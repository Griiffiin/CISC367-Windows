Objects contain keys which are strings (and only strings) mapped to values which may be numbers, strings, objects, or arrays of numbers, strings, objects, or arrays.; in order to produce valid JSON, you need to produce a dictionary which has string keys and values of the appropriate types described above, and feed that dictionary to `json.dumps`."
