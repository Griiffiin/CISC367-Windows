(one or the other, I only had 1 sheet in the workbook to begin with). Some examples as shown here: <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42370977/how-to-save-a-new-sheet-in-an-existing-excel-file-using-pandas/42371251> look similar to what I have and I am not sure how it is different in the form of telling it to add sheets rather than overwrite them."

244,Okay thanks guys this looks promising; <@Caridad> :taco:; <@Claudine> :taco:
252,<@Adolfo> You can use dictionary unpacking and kwargs on __init__ to handle it. it would look like the following
253,seems like it has to do with how you execute run.py
256,okay
257,<@Conchita> I’ll suggest you this video as a brief introduction : <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F37fV0uFf60>; And this course has a nice hands-on w/ Pandas <https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data-analysis>
258,"How can I merge a list of attributes to their associated dictionarys?  My process uses request calls to a list of names, which then I need to make another separate resource request to get individual characteristics that i have to loop each individual separately.  For me to use them later I would like to attach names with their corresponding information.

```names = [""person 1"", ""person 2"", ...]```

for occupation in names to get occupation details associated with each person.
```Occupation =
    {
      ""Occupation"": [
        { ""discipline"": ""Astronaut"", ""rating"": ""trainer"" },
        { ""discipline"": ""Street Juggler"", ""rating"": ""Expert"" }
      ]
    }```

```Occupation =
    {
    ""Occupation"": [
        { ""discipline"": ""Backyard Guitar Player"",""rating"": ""expert"" }
        ]
    }```
.
.
.
Desired result as per below:


```list_ppl_occupation =
[
  {
    ""person 1"":
    {
      ""Occupation"": [
        { ""discipline"": ""Astronaut"", ""rating"": ""trainer"" },
        { ""discipline"": ""Street Juggler"", ""rating"": ""Expert"" }
      ]
    }
  },
  {
    ""person 2"":
    {
    ""Occupation"": [
        { ""discipline"": ""Backyard Guitar Player"",""rating"": ""expert"" }

how can accomplish this?"
260,"You need to break your problem down if you want anyone to answer that, your current question is really, really specific; as I understand it you want to persist something (a login token) across processes. So, you could use something like Redis, a database or even something as simple as a plain-text file; When your beat process starts, just check if the token is there. If it’s not, log in and store the token. If the token has expired and you get an error, repeat the process above.; Protip: When writing a question on stack overflow (or anywhere else) make it as general as possible. If you can’t, then you don’t understand the problem well enough and you should work on improving your understanding of the problem :+1:"
